# Decisions

One line each, newest at the bottom, made during unattended runs. Each says what was decided and why.

## Stage 0: housekeeping
- HARDWARE.md SDK row now says WiSeConnect 4.1.1 on Simplicity SDK 2026.6.1; the 3.5.3 copy stays in the repo (gitignored) for reference only.
- The NWP firmware update is recorded as an **open** row and open item, not "confirmed", because nobody has done it on the board yet.

## Stage 1: S0 foundation
- FAC-01 sits east of WH-01 in the same metre grid and waypoint graph (one engine), so production pallets can reach the warehouse racks on real lanes.
- The site selector is local view state (like the camera), not shared server state: two screens may watch different sites.
- `layout.json` stays the single geometry file (now `riverside-2`); `sites.json` holds sites, zones and commissioned devices.
- GW-01 is never stored in the device registry; its device entry is derived from GatewayStore on every read.
- Every `twin/<site>/…` payload has `source: "sim"` as a schema constant: nothing on site topics can claim to be real.
- The bridge subscribes `twin/#` once (not two overlapping subscriptions) and the engine routes by prefix.
- Device status: online ≤ 15 s (board rule), stale ≤ 60 s, then offline; fault wins.
- `unit_id` relaxed to 1–3 letters so machines can be `M-01` as SITE_PROMPTS.md names them; `source` gains `sim`, `kind` gains `machine` and `worker`.
- Badge positions are a reading whose value is `[x, z]` rather than two separate channels, so x and z never tear.
- Unknown or rejected sim messages produce one warn event per device and reason, so the event log is not flooded.
- Backend MQTT client id is configurable (`TWINDOCK_MQTT_CLIENT_ID`) so a second backend can run beside the user's without kicking it off the broker.
- The warehouse got an east-wall opening and the link lane runs between Zones B and C (z = 18.8), so forklifts never drive through Zone B pallets.
